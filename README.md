# Cinefolio

Personal portfolio website made using Svelte & Firebase. Hosted at [cinefolio.web.app](https://cinefolio.web.app/). The Portfolio is mostly meant to showcase videos, but also in the future we are planning a better support for showcasing coding projects using short videos and/or embedded demos.
